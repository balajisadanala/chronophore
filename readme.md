Sign-io
=======

Sign-io is a simple time-tracking app. People will be able to use it to sign in and sign out, and it will track their hours. It will use a human-readable json file as a 'database', and will be able to generate simple reports from the data.

This project was started to help keep track of students and tutors signing in and out at a tutoring program in a community college, but should be adaptable to other use cases.
